- Hello and greetings to the entire Github and Dev community as a whole. You may have see that my fist (last) post had a bit about me, so here's
an update: Ive received my PGP in Data Science + Data/Business Analytics Nov. 20, 2022.

- I am currently working on mainly my Python skills, in the middle of posting another project.
- Other languages that I am focusing on and practicing are R, SQL, and VBA with Excel. Yes, I know what all the critics say, but trust me that the 
industry is going to thank you for putting some time into Excel VBA.

- My Goal stays the same, amining for all Entry-level Data Scientist positions. I did land 6 Data+Business Analytics offers with 5 of them being remote, and yes........ sadly I turned them down. I'm full speed with Data Science and that's what I have been busting down for the past 2 years for.

- I Current work as a Price/Cost Analyst for a Government Contractor. Yes, I am running models on the databases available to me but need legal green-lights before posting those projects.
