- Hello and greetings to the entire Github and Dev community as a whole. You may have see that my fist (last) post had a bit about me, so here's
an update: Ive received my PGP in Data Science + Data/Business Analytics Nov. 30, 2022 (yes, i know i took 1000 years, had to leave my job to not lose any scaled skills built up from project practicing).

- I am currently working on mainly my Python skills, R (which I find the easiest as well as SQL), and getting to know as much as I can from A.I and big data frameworks.
- Other languages that I am focusing on and practicing are R, SQL, and VBA with Excel. Yes, I know what all the critics say, but trust me that the 
industry is going to thank you for putting some time into Excel VBA.

- My Goal stays the same, applying to all Entry-level Data Scientist positions. I did land a few data+Business Analytics offers with most them being remote, and yes........ sadly I turned them down. I'm fully dedicating my entire dev focus specifically on Machine Learning, Ai optimization, and framework innovations with Data Science and that's what I have been focusing on for the past 2 years.

- I Current work as a Price/Cost Analyst for a Government Contractor. Yes, I am running models on the databases available to me but need legal green-lights before posting those projects.
